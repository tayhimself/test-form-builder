### README.md

A simple form wizard for Sleep disorder screening using
 - a form builder from json
 - a radio button styling using peer classes in tailwindcss
 - a wizard to navigate between the steps
 - tailwindcss
 - static html files and vanilla js

This repo is now deprecated as it is being migrated to Astro which was the plan all along, but this is a good demonstration of what is possible with the platform - a really simple 5 page site with a form builder and user friendly features.


npx tailwindcss -i ./src/main.css -o ./dist/output.css --watch
